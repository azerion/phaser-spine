Before opening this issue _please_ check we haven't already fixed it! Check the [Closed issues](https://github.com/orange-games/phaser-spine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
This Issue is about (delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API (always say which version you're using!)
* An error in the documentation
* An error in the example
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Also mention the Phaser version you're using for your project. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_.
